title Langs

This folder contains numerous Tree Languages.

Some of these languages are just for demonstration and testing purposes.

Some of them are usable. The recommended way to use the languages in the folder is to search the top level `products/` folder and use the compiled Javascript directly.

The usuable languages include Stamp, Hakon, Stump, Swarm, Grammar and Dumbdown.
