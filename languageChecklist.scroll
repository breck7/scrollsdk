title A checklist for creating a new Tree Language from Scratch

list
 - ☑️ Know where to get help. GitHub issues🔗github.com/treenotation/jtree/issues, Tree Notation subreddit🔗reddit.com/r/treenotation, <a href="mailto:treenotation@googlegroups.com">Google Groups</a>, or <a href="mailto:breck7@gmail.com">email Breck</a>.
 - ☑️ Take a look at some of the sample languages in the simple web Tree Language builder🔗jtree.treenotation.org/designer/. You might be able to use these as a reference if you get stuck.
 - ☑️ Open the Tree Language builder🔗jtree.treenotation.org/designer/ or use your own editor (note: only SublimeText4🔗sublimetext.com currently has syntax highlighting for Grammar Languages).
 - ☑️ Name your language. For now, it is recommended that your language name be lowercase, only letters between A-Z, and not a common reserved word like "while/if/true/etc". You are free to name it anything you want, but if you do we ask that you report any bugs you encounter.
 - ☑️ If you are using the Tree Language builder🔗jtree.treenotation.org/designer/, clear the boxes to create a new language from scratch. If you are using your own editor, create a new file with the name "{yourLanguageNameGoesHere}.grammar"
 - ☑️ Create a root nodeType. This will be the root node for your language. It should like this:

psuedoCode
 {yourLanguageNameGoesHere}Node
 root

list
 - ☑️ Add a description line to your new root nodeType. This should describe what the purpose of your language is:

psuedoCode
 {yourLanguageNameGoesHere}Node
  root
  description {thisIsALangageToHelpYouDoX}

list
 - ☑️ Add a top level nodeType to your language. In this example, we'll make a simple language that allows to store your friend's birthdays. Let's add a "friend" nodeType.

grammarCode
 birthdaysNode
  root
  description A language for storing your friend's birthdays.
 friendNode
  description Store information about a friend.

list
 - ☑️ Now let's add an inScope line to the root node so that the friend node is in scope:

grammarCode
 birthdaysNode
  root
  description A language for storing your friend's birthdays.
  inScope friendNode
 friendNode
  description Store information about a friend.

list
 - ☑️ Now the following is a valid program in your language:

code
 friend
 friend
 friend

list
 - ☑️ Now let's add a "name" nodeType under the friend nodeType's scope. We're start hiding some already mentioned code with "..." 

psuedoCode
 ...
 friendNode
  description Store information about a friend.
  inScope nameNode
 nameNode

list
 - ☑️ Now the following is a valid program in your language:

psuedoCode
 friend
  name
 friend
  name
 ...

list
 - ☑️ Now let's add a "cellType", which let's us start getting things like type checking, syntax highlighting, and autocomplete. By the *current* convention, we put the cellTypes at the top of our grammar file.

psuedoCode
 nameCell
  highlightScope string
 ...

list
 - ☑️ Now let's make the name nodeType accept a "catch all" cellType of the nameCell.

psuedoCode
 ...
 nameNode
  catchAllCellType nameCell

list
 - ☑️ Now the following is a valid program in your language:

code
 friend
  name Ben Franklin
 friend
  name Ada Lovelace

list
 - ☑️ Now let's add an error nodeType, and link it to the rootNode, to catch errors:

grammarCode
 birthdaysNode
  root
  description A language for storing your friend's birthdays.
  inScope friendNode
  catchAllNodeType errorNode
 errorNode
  baseNodeType errorNode

list
 - ☑️ Now you should get an error for a program like this:

code
 frieeeend
  name Ben Franklin

 That's all for now! Let us know what you need to do next. Of course, we haven't really gotten to the fun stuff yet. Languages get really interesting once you start implementing the "interesting methods", like compile, execute, render, and format.
