- 🏥 version number fix

# 64.0.0 2023-1-30
* This releases introduced a new language called Tree Query Language (TQL) for quering TrueBases. This release may have some bugs, you may want to wait before upgrading.

- 🎉 Grammar: constants are now available on the grammar definition nodes at runtime in addition to instance nodes.
- ⚠️ BREAKING: TrueBaseServer has been rewritten and basic search has been replaced by TQL search.

# 63.0.0 2023-1-26
* This is a major release that makes the code more modular and eliminates a lot of technical debt. In the past to simplify NodeJs+Browser isomorphism I created the `jtree` namespace and bundled everything together. This was a mistake. This release fixes that, and makes each subproject more independent. This should speed up future development.

- ⚠️ BREAKING: Replace all `jtree.getVersion()` with `TreeNode.getVersion()`
- ⚠️ BREAKING: `products/TreeNotationCodeMirrorMode.js` is now `products/GrammarCodeMirrorMode.js`
- ⚠️ BREAKING: The bundled file `jtree.browser.js` is now deprecated. That file will be kept for now (for external links) but will no longer be updated and will be removed in a future version. Include exactly what you need.
* Before:
code
 <script src="../products/jtree.browser.js"></script>
* After: (to get everything that was previously in the bundle)
code
 <script src="../products/Utils.browser.js"></script>
 <script src="../products/TreeNode.browser.js"></script>
 <script src="../products/GrammarLanguage.browser.js"></script>
 <script src="../products/GrammarCodeMirrorMode.browser.js"></script>


- ⚠️ BREAKING: The `jtree` namespace is no more. Include exactly what you need:
* Before:
code
 const {jtree} = require("jtree")
 const tree = new jtree.TreeNode("hello world")
* After:
code
 const {TreeNode} = require("jtree/products/TreeNode.js")
 const tree = new TreeNode("hello world")


# 62.2.0 2023-1-12
- 🎉 removed jtree.node.js and added instructions for only importing the specific product needed directly.

# 62.1.0 2023-1-12
- 🎉 new Node products to import directly from: GrammarLanguage.js, TreeNode.js, TestRacer.js, GrammarCompiler.js

# 62.0.0 2023-1-11

# 56.0.1 2022-09-26
- 🏥 minor dependency bump

# 56.0.0 2022-08-31
- ⚠️ BREAKING: removed the keyword `abstract` from Grammar Language. Grammar Language is now a suffix AND prefix language. The functionality of abstract node type definitions is identical, but now instead of flagging them with the `abstract` keyword, you need to ensure that the node type definition id begins with the word `abstract`. This turned out to be the best design pattern already, so you may already do this, and then the migration step is simple—just delete all occurrences of `/^ abstract\n/` in your `*.grammar` files. In the rare chance you have any nodes that are not abstract whose id's begin with the prefix `abstract`, you will need to give those nodes a new id.
