This was a refactor of Grammar to support scoped parsers. I also took the opportunity to switch more `get()` methods to getters.

🎉 Grammar: constants are now available on the grammar definition nodes at runtime in addition to instance nodes.
⚠️ BREAKING: TrueBaseServer has been rewritten and basic search has been replaced by TQL search.

📦 63.0.0 2023-1-26
This is a major release that makes the code more modular and eliminates a lot of technical debt. In the past to simplify NodeJs+Browser isomorphism I created the `jtree` namespace and bundled everything together. This was a mistake. This release fixes that, and makes each subproject more independent. This should speed up future development.

⚠️ BREAKING: Replace all `jtree.getVersion()` with `Particle.getVersion()`
⚠️ BREAKING: `products/TreeNotationCodeMirrorMode.js` is now `products/ParsersCodeMirrorMode.js`
⚠️ BREAKING: The bundled file `jtree.browser.js` is now deprecated. That file will be kept for now (for external links) but will no longer be updated and will be removed in a future version. Include exactly what you need.
Before:
code
 <script src="../products/jtree.browser.js"></script>
After: (to get everything that was previously in the bundle)
code
 <script src="../products/Utils.browser.js"></script>
 <script src="../products/Particle.browser.js"></script>
 <script src="../products/Parsers.ts.browser.js"></script>
 <script src="../products/ParsersCodeMirrorMode.browser.js"></script>


⚠️ BREAKING: The `jtree` namespace is no more. Include exactly what you need:
Before:
code
 const {jtree} = require("jtree")
 const tree = new jtree.Particle("hello world")
After:
code
 const {Particle} = require("jtree/products/Particle.js")
 const tree = new Particle("hello world")


📦 62.2.0 2023-1-12
🎉 removed jtree.node.js and added instructions for only importing the specific product needed directly.

📦 62.1.0 2023-1-12
🎉 new Node products to import directly from: Parsers.js, Particle.js, TestRacer.js, ParsersCompiler.js

📦 62.0.0 2023-1-11
⚠️ Removed Upgrader. In practice better handled by an external package which can have multiple versions of jtree as dependencies.
🎉 export `Utils` as top level export

📦 61.4.1 2023-1-8
🏥 TrueBase: search server fixes

🎉 Performance improvements to core (typed map method).

📦 56.0.1 2022-09-26
🏥 minor dependency bump

📦 56.0.0 2022-08-31
⚠️ BREAKING: removed the keyword `abstract` from Grammar Language. Grammar Language is now a suffix AND prefix language. The functionality of abstract node type definitions is identical, but now instead of flagging them with the `abstract` keyword, you need to ensure that the node type definition id begins with the word `abstract`. This turned out to be the best design pattern already, so you may already do this, and then the migration step is simple—just delete all occurrences of `/^ abstract\n/` in your `*.grammar` files. In the rare chance you have any nodes that are not abstract whose id's begin with the prefix `abstract`, you will need to give those nodes a new id.

📦 55.1.1 2022-08-18
🏥 TrueBase: fixed error reporting bug.
